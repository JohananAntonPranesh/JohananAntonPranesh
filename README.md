I am a graduate student in Financial Engineering at Lehigh University with a passion for machine learning, optimization, factor models, and alternative data. My work spans multiple projects, and I have experience in the front office of a hedge fund, focusing on data science and quantitative research.

I have a particular interest in variance reduction methods like SVRG and the SARAH model, as well as Rust programming for high-performance computing. Beyond finance and technology, I enjoy running for charities, playing golf and squash, painting, and writing essaysâ€”one of which was published and earned me a human rights award.

I am always exploring new research opportunities in Quant Finance, machine learning, and optimization. Feel free to connect with me!
